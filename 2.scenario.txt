“Dad, I'm sorry, but I want to find the Red rain, so I have to go,” 
David says.
&
“Get out here! I’ve never had a son like you!” 
David's dad says with extreme anger.
&
He uses all his strength to close the door to show his disappointment. 
“I don't want to see you anymore!”
&
David silences and leaves,
&
“Please, David calm down, come back! There is no Red rain at all, it’s a fantasy!” 
David’s mom opens the door and yells.

David runs away quickly after hearing his mom's voice because he knows his
determination would be ambiguous if he saw his mothers's pale face.

David leaves, he keeps chasing his dream although 
he knows nobody will understand him.
