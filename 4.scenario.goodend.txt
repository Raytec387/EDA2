The rain becomes heavier, and David is going to die. 
&
Suddenly, he saw it in the last moment of his life, the Red rain. 
He found it, 
&
he deceived his eyes and he found the
Red rain which doesn't exist in the world at all. 
&
This Red rain only belongs
to David, because no one else can see it.
&
“It exists, it exists…” 
David takes his last breath and says, 
&
“But there is a little difference… 
&
I don’t feel any warmth as the Storybook said, 
&
I even feel a little cold…”
&
David closed his eyes permanently, but he smiled.
&
When he became an adult, he walked many useless ways although many people
praised him as a hero. 
&
When he was in the last moment of his life, he didn’t win over
the bad people as a hero.
&
Was he a failure? Did he have an awful life? 
&
Well, there is nobody who can exactly define how he was, 
&
but at least, 
&
he wouldn’t be suffering from this world anymore after the Red rain.
&
Nobody can deceive you totally except yourself. — the Red rain
