One day, he comes to a town located near the Dead Sea. 
He is quite curious about the people who have pale faces, 
&
he asks a boy who is crying for the reason.
&
"What happens, little boy?" 
David says and he attempts to wipe his tears.
&
"My mom is dead," 
the boy says with a trembling voice, 
&
"My mom was killed by a crowd of men, 
they stole our food, and money and killed a lot of people"
&
"They are pirates!"
A frightened woman says loudly, 
&
"They come here almost once a month. I know you! You’re David, you are a hero, right? 
Then please please save us! Everyone’s suffering because of this!"
&
After the woman says that, David knows this time is very dangerous,
you might lose the opportunity to accomplish the dream.
David decides to...

1. Flee away for the dream			2. Help them

David decides to help people without thinking as he always does, 
he will wait until the following month when the pirates will attack again.
&
A month later, the pirates come and they hold arms such as swords, knives, or bows. 
&
Fortunately, because of the adventure, David gets good skills in sword fighting. 
David holds his sword, sits on the rock, and closes his eyes to wait for his final battle.

"The weather looks like it's going to rain," David sighs.
