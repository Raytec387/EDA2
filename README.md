Open world: The game world is structured as a Scenario Graph. Using the console and graph data, Each scenario has a segment of the story and involves some form of battle or decision-making. Upon completing a scenario (by winning all battles within it), the player can move to any of the adjacent scenarios in the graph.

The first session 24/04/2024 - 08/05/2024:
  1. We create a branch called character in Github, and in there we will upload files such as common.h, character.h, etc.
  In character.h, we implement the data structure of the main character, the Skill of the main character, and the enemy.

  2. The game story will be based on a self-created story called Red Rain. The background is in Middle Ages.
