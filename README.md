The first session 24/04/2024 - 08/05/2024:
  1. We create a branch called character in Github, and in there we will upload files such as common.h, character.h, etc.
  In character.h, we implement the data structure of the main character, the skills of the main character, and the enemy.

  2. The game story will be based on a self-created story called Red Rain. The background is in Middle Ages.
